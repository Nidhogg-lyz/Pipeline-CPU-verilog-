# Pipeline-CPU-verilog-
Using verilog and ModelSim to build a pipeline CPU
PipeRegs.v defines the regs between each stage of the pipeline CPU

element.v defines the essential units
There are already some instructions defined in IM, and some test data in DataMem

test.v is for final test and you should run module P_CPUt to check

pipe.txt records some test instructions
